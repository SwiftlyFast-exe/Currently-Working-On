# Gorilla Cam
I am working on a GorillaTag mod that is similar to the Orion Drift Spectator camera in terms of it being a customizable camera system. With **Gorilla Cam**, users will be able to add their own scripts using environment variables to build custom functionality and extend features inside of **Gorilla Cam**.  
By default, **Gorilla Cam** will include a built-in **Free CAM**, and users will have the ability to create their own scripts to modify how the camera works, enabling unique features without needing to know advanced modding techniques.  
Scripting knowledge will still be required, as scripts will initially be written in **C#**. However, I also plan to support **Luau** in the future for even greater flexibility.
We are also looking for developers if they wish to help out! However, it will only be to speed up the process, no matter what, **Gorilla Cam** Will come out.
